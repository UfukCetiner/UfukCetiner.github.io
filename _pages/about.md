I’m an Aerospace Engineering student at Imperial College London with a passion for hands-on design and creative problem-solving. Whether it’s designing systems that fly, float, or fold, I enjoy turning ideas into functional prototypes.

I often take part in design competitions to explore new ideas and push my technical and creative boundaries. From UAVs to small-scale mechanical systems, I like building things that do more than just sit on paper.

I’m currently expanding my skills in 3D modeling and visualization (Blender, Fusion 360, SOLIDWORKS), while diving deeper into electronics, control systems, and embedded design. Alongside that, my academic work challenges me to apply core aerospace principles — from aerodynamics to structures and materials — to design and build real systems, like a small-scale wind turbine capable of producing actual power output.

I’m always up for a challenge — especially ones that require both engineering logic and a bit of imagination.
