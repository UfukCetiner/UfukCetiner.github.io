The project constraints were as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Must be a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT)</li> <li>Max Turbine Diameter: 0.5 m</li> <li>Self-Starting Speed: 10 m/s</li> <li>Must rotate clockwise when viewed from wind direction</li> <li>Turbine must be upwind of the tower</li> </ul> <p>In addition to these initial considerations, teams faced further manufacturing and budget constraints. Each group was allocated a total budget of £100 and was limited to specific manufacturing techniques and materials. Only laser cutting and 3D printing were permitted—laser cutting was free, while 3D printing cost £5 per hour for the first 3 hours and £25 per hour thereafter. The approved materials included plywood, balsa wood, acrylic, tough PLA, carbon fiber strips, epoxy, and steel rods. However, the use of epoxy or any other adhesives as fillers or mold materials was strictly prohibited.</p> <p>Given these constraints, teams were tasked with designing blades capable of generating maximum power through aerodynamic analysis and structural calculations. The teams had three weeks to finalize their designs, after which no modifications were allowed during the manufacturing phase (2 weeks).</p> <p>Our team was divided into three sub-teams: Aero, Structures, and CAD/Manufacturing. While my primary role was within the CAD/Manufacturing group, I also contributed to the aerodynamic design efforts. The following is a comprehensive account of our team’s work throughout the project.</p> <h1 id="aerodynamic-calculations">Aerodynamic Calculations</h1> <p>The Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory was used to estimate the performance of the wind turbine blades. BEM combines blade element theory with momentum theory to calculate the forces on each blade section by dividing the blade into small elements and evaluating local flow conditions. From this, the total thrust and torque can be computed, and subsequently, the power output of the turbine. Accurate performance prediction with BEM requires reliable airfoil polar data (typically lift and drag vs. angle of attack) for each blade section, as these values directly influence the force calculations at each element. To improve the fidelity of the model, several correction factors were applied: the Prandtl tip loss correction accounts for the reduction in lift near the blade tip due to finite span effects; the tangential induction factor (a’) adjusts for angular momentum extraction; the root-loss correction models losses near the blade hub; and the stall delay correction accounts for delayed flow separation on rotating blades.</p> <p>The airfoils used in the blade design were selected based on literature specific to low Reynolds number performance in small-scale wind turbines. The SG (Selig) family of airfoils, particularly designed for low-speed applications, has been highlighted in multiple academic sources for their high aerodynamic efficiency. Among these, the SG6043 stood out due to its high CL/CD​ ratio across a wide angle-of-attack range, making it an excellent candidate for maximizing power output in moderate wind conditions.</p> <p>However, integrating the SG6043 directly at the blade root posed significant structural challenges. Our initial prototypes revealed that the abrupt geometric transition from a thick circular root (necessary for mounting and load transfer) to the thin trailing edge of the SG6043 introduced high stress concentrations and manufacturing difficulties. To address this, we implemented a gradual geometric transition using a sequence of NACA 4-digit airfoils: NACA 4424, NACA 4420, and NACA 4416, tapering smoothly into the SG6043 at the outer blade span. This not only reduced structural stress at the critical root region but also improved manufacturability and load distribution along the blade.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/thickness_problem-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/thickness_problem-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/thickness_problem-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/thickness_problem.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="600px" height="auto" title="Initial Blade w/o Transition" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> This was an initial look at the blade design. Without the transition region aerofoils, the blade suffered from a sharp transition from the thick circular root. </div> <p>To run Blade Element Momentum (BEM) calculations with these airfoils, the team generated the necessary aerodynamic polars using XFOIL, a widely used panel method tool for low-Re simulations. These CL​ and CD​ vs. angle-of-attack curves provided the core input for our BEM performance model, enabling force and power predictions across varying operational conditions. While XFOIL provided a fast and accessible way to generate polar data, its accuracy at very low Reynolds numbers and post-stall behavior remains limited — something we would come to realize during post-testing analysis.</p> <h3 id="twist-and-chord-distributions">Twist and Chord Distributions</h3> <p>One of the key aspects of aerodynamic blade design is defining the twist and chord distributions along the blade span. Because the tangential velocity increases with radius, each airfoil section along the blade operates at a different local flow angle. The twist distribution compensates for this by adjusting the local pitch of the airfoil, ensuring each section operates near its optimal angle of attack — as determined from the CL​/CD​ trends in the XFOIL-generated polars.</p> <p>To calculate the ideal twist and chord, our team initially used analytical relationships derived from Glauert’s optimum rotor theory, which assumes maximum power extraction under ideal (Betz-optimal) conditions. These equations distribute twist inversely with radius and produce high chord values near the hub where wind speed is low but torque production is critical. However, in practice, the resulting bulky root sections posed significant challenges: they were difficult to transition into from the circular hub geometry, required large amounts of material, and were not easily manufacturable within the given manufacturing constraints.</p> <p>To mitigate this, we turned to academic studies focused on small-scale turbine manufacturing. One particularly insightful recommendation was to begin linearizing the twist and chord distributions starting from 70–90% of the blade span — essentially tapering the aerodynamic sections smoothly into a structural root. This method simplifies both geometry and material usage, while maintaining acceptable aerodynamic performance. Our team adopted this approach, introducing a gradual transition from the aerodynamic SG6043 profile into more robust NACA sections, and eventually to a circular root profile.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/idealvslinearized-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/idealvslinearized-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/idealvslinearized-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/idealvslinearized.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Ideal vs Linearized" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> These graphs show the ideal vs linearized chord and twist distributions. The linearized distributions are the ones our teams used in manufacturing the blade. </div> <p>This adjustment greatly reduced material cost and manufacturing complexity, which we considered a major win at the time. Interestingly, simulations showed no drop in predicted performance — in fact, the linearized design outperformed the theoretical optimum in our model, which in hindsight should have raised some eyebrows.</p> <p>Looking back, one of our key oversights was placing too much trust in the research paper we referenced. While linearizing the chord distribution can be physically justified — as it primarily affects surface area and loading distribution — linearizing the twist lacks a solid aerodynamic basis. Twist is directly tied to the inflow angle experienced by each blade section, which depends on local blade speed and wind velocity. Deviating from the ideal twist essentially shifts the operating point away from the airfoil’s optimal AoA. This subtle but important difference wasn’t fully appreciated at the time.</p> <p>It’s likely that limitations in our simulation pipeline, especially the use of XFOIL at very low Reynolds numbers, further masked the aerodynamic penalties of the twist approximation. But in the excitement of simplifying the design and making visible progress, we didn’t stop to question whether those gains were real — or just numerical illusions.</p> <h3 id="starting-torque-the-critical-oversight">Starting Torque: The Critical Oversight</h3> <p>A final but crucial consideration in the aerodynamic analysis of the blade is its starting torque. Unlike steady-state conditions, real-world wind turbines must overcome the initial resistive torque of the generator — in our case, a small dynamometer — from complete rest. This means the blades must extract rotational energy from low-speed wind even when their angular velocity is zero.</p> <p>Our BEM analysis estimated a starting torque approximately double the dyno’s resistive torque. Encouraged by this safety margin of two, we concluded that the turbine would reliably self-start under expected wind conditions. Since starting torque is strongly influenced by the root chord length, and our simulations showed favorable results, we opted not to modify the geometry further.</p> <p>However, in testing, the turbine failed to self-start entirely. This was a key moment of realization: our confidence in the starting torque predictions had been based on overly optimistic input data — particularly the airfoil polars generated by XFOIL, which are known to underpredict stall and overestimate lift at very low Reynolds numbers. In addition, our “safe” factor of two left little room for real-world uncertainties like frictional losses, turbulent gusts, and delayed flow development at startup.</p> <p>In hindsight, we underestimated the critical role of starting torque in small-scale turbine performance. A more conservative approach would have been to run BEM simulations at lower wind speeds to assess startup performance under more challenging conditions. Verifying that the turbine could overcome resistive torque in weaker winds would have provided an extra layer of safety margin, and likely would have exposed the overconfidence in our model far earlier in the process.</p> <p>Instead, we learned (the hard way) that startup dynamics deserve just as much attention as peak efficiency in practical blade design.</p> <h2 id="-lessons-learned">🧠 Lessons Learned</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Don’t trust simulation results blindly</strong> — validate them using experimental data.</li> <li> <strong>XFOIL can be misleading</strong> at low Reynolds numbers.</li> <li> <strong>Linearizing twist isn’t physically justified</strong> — chord, yes; twist, no.</li> <li> <strong>Starting torque needs aggressive safety margins</strong> — theory alone won’t make a blade spin.</li> </ul> <h1 id="structural-calculations">Structural Calculations</h1> <p>In parallel with the aerodynamic design, other members of the team conducted a detailed structural analysis to ensure the blade could withstand operational loads without compromising performance.</p> <p>Using MATLAB, the structural group estimated aerodynamic loading along the blade span (based on BEM results) and applied the shoelace formula to calculate cross-sectional areas for each blade segment. These areas were used to compute bending moments, and the resulting Von Mises stresses were evaluated — including contributions from centrifugal forces due to rotation.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/structures1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/structures1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/structures1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/structures1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Top Stress Distro" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/structures2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/structures2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/structures2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/structures2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Bottom Stress Distro" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> These figures show the stress distributions on the top and bottom surface of our blade. </div> <p>To guide material selection, the team compared the calculated stresses against allowable values for different candidate materials.

More importantly it enabled us to orient the grain direction of the plywood perpendicular to the main aerodynamic loads which increased the blade’s strength and safety margin by aligning the material’s strongest axis with the dominant bending stresses.</p> <p>Each section was laser cut from 0.8 mm plywood to capture fine geometric detail.

The blade came out precisely manufactured, lightweight, and balanced. Clever decisions — like aligning plywood grain with aerodynamic loading and using transition airfoils to ease structural stress — paid off in fabrication and form. On the other hand, overly optimistic assumptions in simulation led to a blade that didn’t self-start, revealing just how fragile performance predictions can be when models aren’t stress-tested.</p> <p>That experience taught me to be skeptical of “perfect” outputs, to question inputs more critically, and to design with margin — especially when working at low Reynolds numbers or with experimental data like XFOIL.</p> <p>It also sharpened my ability to collaborate across domains, prototype quickly, and adapt designs under constraints. Above all, it reminded me that setbacks aren’t failures — they’re feedback. And I’m genuinely proud of both the outcome and the learning curve behind it.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/homage1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/homage1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/homage1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/homage1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Sliced across the z-axis" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/homage2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/homage2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/homage2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/homage2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Sliced across the x-axis" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Some memories from the workshop. </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Ufuk Cetiner. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
